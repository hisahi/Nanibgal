# Nanibgal
This README document is still a work in progress.

A microblogging service created for a school project. The name comes from ones of the epithets of [Nidaba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nidaba), the Sumerian goddess of writing and learning. The service supports:

- An authentication system for users
- Posting posts up to 256 characters long
- Posts may contain an additional link
- Posts may refer to other posts and act as replies to them
- Liking posts
- Following specific people
- Editing posts 5-10 minutes after they have been posted
- Deleting posts
- Using an administrative system for deleting posts and banning users
- A notification system
